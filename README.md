# Portfolio project

This is a portfolio containing an overview of my accomplishments and abilities. Some of the main features are the use of THREE.js and supporting libraries along with some animation libraries. Along with the projects mentioned within the app itself, it's important to note this portfolio is also a demonstration of my skills.

## Technologies used

- React (using Vite)
- THREE.js (react-three/drei and React-Three/fiber)
- Tailwind css
- React-tilt (react library for container with a tilt effect)
- React-vertical-timeline (react library for loading vertical timeline)
- Emailjs (automatically sending messages upon filling up contact details)
- framer-motion (library for easier animations)
